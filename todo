Discard repetition check in search routines (they should now be replaced by repetition checks)
Repeated attacks should not include attacks between same type of pieces
Check extensions
Repetition: board should detect repeated attackings for more than 4 plies
Repeated attacking detection: examine the attacking list of the moving piece, instead of the evasion piece
Evaluate recapture in qsearch
Generate checks in the first ply of qsearch
Bitboard
Futility/Delta pruning
Don't try null-move pruning when there's few remaining material
More decent evalutions: king safety, score of cannon and horse should vary with remain pieces on board
